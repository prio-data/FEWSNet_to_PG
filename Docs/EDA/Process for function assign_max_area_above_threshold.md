#### Process for function `assign_max_above_threshold_with_fallback.py`

The primary goal of this function is to **assign each `pg_id` the maximum value, but only if it occupies a sufficiently large proportion of the area**. If no value meets the **Proportional_area threshold**, the function **falls back to a weighted sum of values**. This ensures that **dominant high values are prioritized**, but a fallback mechanism prevents data loss in cases where no single value meets the threshold.

The final output is a DataFrame where each `pg_id` has:
1. A **dissolved_value**, which is either:
   - The **maximum value** that exceeds the **Proportional_area threshold**.
   - A **weighted sum of values by area** if no values exceed the threshold.

### **Considerations:**
This function **DOES NOT** blindly assign the highest valueâ€”it **first ensures that the value is spatially dominant** before doing so. This makes it more **cautious than an aggressive max-assignment function**, while still allowing extreme values to be retained when justified.

It is particularly useful for:
- **Food security classification**, where **high-severity areas should only dominate if they are spatially significant**.
- **Land-use or conflict mapping**, where the **dominant feature should only be assigned if it is sufficiently extensive**.
- **Predictive modeling**, ensuring that **important but minor outliers do not over-skew results**.

---

### **The process:**

#### **Step 1:** Identify Rows That Meet the Proportional Threshold
- Purpose: Filter out values that **do not meet the minimum required Proportional_area**.
- Action:
    - Keep only rows where **Proportional_area >= threshold**.
    - If **any valid values remain**, assign the **maximum** among them.

```python
valid_values = group[group['Proportional_area'] >= threshold]

if not valid_values.empty:
    dissolved_value = valid_values['value'].max()
``` 

#### **Step 2:** Apply Fallback When No Values Meet the Threshold

Purpose: Ensure that every pg_id receives a value, even when no dominant value is present.
Action:
If no values meet the threshold, compute a weighted sum using Proportional_area as the weight.
This ensures that a reasonable aggregate value is assigned, rather than an arbitrary maximum.

``` 
else:
    dissolved_value = (group['value'] * group['Proportional_area']).sum()
```
#### **Step 3:** Store Results in a Structured Format

- Purpose: Convert the output into a structured DataFrame.
- Action:
    - Append the identified dissolved_value for each pg_id to a results list.

``` 
results.append({'pg_id': pg_id, 'dissolved_value': dissolved_value})
```

#### Advantages of this selection

**Prevents Small, Insignificant High Values from Dominating**
- Ensures that only sufficiently large features can dominate.
-  Prevents small, extreme values from misleadingly driving results.

**Retains Extreme Values When Justified**

- If a high value meets the threshold, it is assigned without dilution.
- Ensures that critical food insecurity levels, conflict events, or other high-impact data points remain visible.

**Intelligent Fallback Ensures Data Completeness**

- When no values exceed the threshold, the function does not discard the data.
- Instead, it aggregates using weighted proportions, maintaining consistency across all pg_id values.

**Balances Caution with Sensitivity**

- More conservative than a strict maximum function.
- More aggressive than a proportional area-based weighted sum.

#### Limitations

**Threshold Selection is Static**
- The Proportional_area threshold is fixed (default = 0.2), meaning it does not adapt dynamically to different data distributions.
- Possible Improvement: Use percentile-based thresholds instead of a fixed number.

**Extreme Values Can Still Dominate If They Just Barely Meet the Threshold**

- If a high value is just above the threshold, it will be assigned even if another value is nearly as large.
- Possible Improvement: Implement a secondary check to prevent edge-case dominance.

**Weighted Sum Fallback May Underestimate High Values**

- The fallback uses weighted sums, meaning high values could get diluted if they are mixed with lower values.
- Possible Improvement: Use a weighted max approach where values are scaled by Proportional_area but do not get overly averaged.
