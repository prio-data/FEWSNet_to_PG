#### Process for function `calculate_weighted_values.py`

The primary goal of this function is to **aggregate values at the `pg_id` level** by calculating weighted values based on **Proportional_area**. This function **directly applies area-based weighting** to each value within a `pg_id`, ensuring that the final aggregated values reflect the spatial proportion of each contributing feature.

The final output is a DataFrame where each `pg_id` has:
1. A **dissolved_value**, which is the sum of all weighted values within that `pg_id`.

### **Considerations:**
This function **DOES NOT** account for **population or any other external reference metric**. Instead, it strictly relies on **spatial extent (Proportional_area)** to determine how much influence each feature has on the final value.

This approach **ensures consistency** in cases where **area-based proportionality is the primary concern** (e.g., environmental attributes, land-based resource distribution). However, it may not be suitable for human-centric analyses where **population weighting** could be more appropriate.

---

### **The process:**

#### **Step 1:** Calculate the Weighted Value for Each Row
- Purpose: Assign a **weighted value** to each feature by multiplying **value** by **Proportional_area**.
- Action:
    - Each feature's contribution is adjusted based on its proportional area within a `pg_id`.

```python
group['weighted_value'] = group['value'] * group['Proportional_area']
``` 

#### **Step 2:** Sum the Weighted Values at the pg_id Level

- Purpose: Aggregate the calculated weights for each pg_id to produce a final dissolved value.
    - Action:
    - Group by pg_id and sum all weighted_value values.

``` 
dissolved_df = group.groupby('pg_id', as_index=False)['weighted_value'].sum()
```

#### **Step 3:** Rename and Return the Results

- Purpose: Ensure column clarity.
    - Action:
    - Rename weighted_value to dissolved_value for better interpretability.
- Output: Return the cleaned and aggregated DataFrame.

```
dissolved_df.rename(columns={'weighted_value': 'dissolved_value'}, inplace=True)
return dissolved_df
```

#### Advantages of this selection
**Simple and Efficient**

- Lightweight and computationally efficient, making it ideal for large datasets.
- Uses direct multiplication and aggregation, minimizing processing overhead.

**Ensures Proportional Representation**

- Preserves spatial proportionality by ensuring that features covering more area contribute more to the final value.
- Suitable for datasets where spatial extent is the primary determinant of influence.

**Predictable and Transparent**

- Uses a clear and intuitive methodology, making it easy to interpret results.
- No complex decision rulesâ€”all values are strictly based on area proportions.

#### Limitations

**Ignores Population or Other Contextual Factors**

- The function only considers Proportional_area, meaning it does not account for population, economic factors, or other variables that might influence the significance of a value.
- Possible Improvement: Introduce alternative weighting metrics (e.g., Proportion_population).

**Over-Smooths Values Across Space**

- Since every feature contributes proportionally, high-value small areas might get diluted when summed into larger pg_id regions.
- Possible Improvement: Implement threshold-based or selective weighting to avoid excessive smoothing.
