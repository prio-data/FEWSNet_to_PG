#### Process for function `assign_combined_threshold.py`

The primary goal of this function is to assign a value to each `pg_id` based on a set of combined threshold rules. It achieves this by prioritizing rows that meet both a **proportional area threshold** and a **critical value threshold**. If no rows meet these criteria, the function falls back to calculating a **weighted sum** of values based on the `Proportional_area` column. The final output is a DataFrame with a `dissolved_value` assigned to each `pg_id`.

### **Considerations:**
This function is designed to ensure that **the most consequential values** are assigned to a `pg_id`. The prioritization of values meeting both the proportional and critical thresholds ensures that highly significant values are selected when available. The fallback mechanism (weighted sum) prevents the function from returning null or misleading results when no direct threshold match is found.

This function **DOES NOT** consider the absolute magnitude of the `value` column in relation to external reference points (e.g., regional or national statistics) or cell *population attributes*. Instead, it operates strictly within each `pg_id`, meaning its calculations are relative to the local data distribution.

---

### **The process:**

#### **Step 1:** Identify Rows That Meet Both Thresholds

- Purpose: Filter out rows that meet the **minimum proportional threshold** and **critical value threshold**.

```python
filtered = group[(group['Proportional_area'] >= proportional_threshold) & (group['value'] > critical_value)]
```

- If any rows satisfy both thresholds, the function selects the maximum value from the filtered subset to ensure that the highest relevant value is chosen.

``` 
dissolved_value = filtered['value'].max()
```

#### **Step 2:** Calculate Weighted Sum as a Fallback

If no rows meet both thresholds, the function calculates a weighted sum of values using the Proportional_area column.

```
dissolved_value = (group['value'] * group['Proportional_area']).sum()
```

#### **Step 3:** Aggregate Results at the pg_id Level

```
results.append({'pg_id': pg_id, 'dissolved_value': dissolved_value})
```

#### Differentiating this process from proportional area mapping:

This process is more sensitive to high food insecurity classifications compared to basic proportional area weighting, because it allows for more extreme values to be retained in some pg_id cells.

- Instead of blindly applying proportional area weighting, it first prioritizes values that meet a critical threshold, ensuring that the most meaningful values are selected first. This helps avoid cases where a disproportionately low value is assigned due to small spatial fragments that do not accurately reflect local conditions.

- The initiative to incorporate this function is to avoid dilution of consequential food insecurity values
    - Whereas a proportional area function will assign values strictly based on area proportion, even if the most relevant data is in a smaller area that gets diluted. With `assign_combined_threshold.py` if any rows within a pg_id exceed both the proportional threshold (ensuring spatial relevance) and the critical value threshold (ensuring statistical significance), the function selects the highest value instead of weighting everything equally.
    - Ensures that high-impact values remain intact if they are sufficiently prominent, preserving outliers and regions of concern that might otherwise be averaged away.

- Maintains proportional area mapping as a fallback:
    - Uses area-based weighting only as a fallback if no values meet the primary significance criteria. This enhances interpretability, as selected values better reflect actual food security classifications rather than arbitrary spatial proportions.

#### Advantages of this selection:
- Robust Prioritization of Significant Values

- Ensures that when possible, the most relevant values (those meeting both thresholds) are chosen first.
    - Prevents lower-impact values from skewing the representation of food security classifications.
    - Prevents Data Loss with a Weighted Fallback

- Instead of discarding groups where no value meets the threshold, the function calculates a meaningful weighted sum based on proportional area.
- Ensures that every pg_id is assigned a value, maintaining data integrity.
- Efficient Handling of Spatial Data

- Works at the grid-cell level, making it compatible with large-scale geospatial datasets like PRIOGrid.
- The function is designed to be computationally efficient by grouping and processing data iteratively.
