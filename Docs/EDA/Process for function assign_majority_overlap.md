#### Process for function `assign_majority_overlap.py`

The primary goal of this function is to **assign each `pg_id` the value that occupies the largest proportion of its area**. Instead of averaging or weighting multiple values, this function **selects the dominant value based purely on spatial extent**, ensuring that the **most representative** value for each `pg_id` is retained.

The final output is a DataFrame where each `pg_id` has:
1. A **dissolved_value**, which represents the value associated with the **largest Proportional_area** within that `pg_id`.

### **Considerations:**
This function is best suited for **categorical** or **classification-based data** where the goal is to **preserve the most dominant category** rather than blending values. It **DOES NOT** apply any form of **weighting or averaging**â€”the assigned value is strictly determined by which feature covers the largest area.

This method is particularly useful for cases such as:
- **Land use classification** (e.g., determining the primary land use type within each grid cell).
- **Administrative boundaries** (e.g., associating a `pg_id` with the region that occupies most of its area).
- **Food security classification** (e.g., assigning the most dominant IPC category within each grid).

### **The process:**

#### **Step 1:** Group by `pg_id` and Identify the Dominant Value
- Purpose: Determine the **value** associated with the **largest Proportional_area** in each `pg_id`.
- Action:
    - Identify the row with the **maximum Proportional_area** within each `pg_id`.
    - Select the **corresponding value**.

```python
for pg_id, group in df.groupby(pg_id_column):
    dominant_row = group.loc[group['Proportional_area'].idxmax()]
    dominant_value = dominant_row['value']
```  

### **Step 2:** Store the Results in a Structured Format

- Purpose: Convert the results into a structured DataFrame.
- Action:
    - Append the identified dominant value for each pg_id to a results list.

``` 
results.append({'pg_id': pg_id, 'dissolved_value': dominant_value})
```

#### Advantages of this selection

**Preserves the Most Representative Value**

- Ensures that only the dominant category is assigned to each pg_id, making it ideal for categorical data.
- Avoids blending or dilution of discrete values, which is useful in classification problems.

**Computationally Efficient**

- Uses simple row selection and grouping, making it faster and more efficient than weighting-based methods.
- Avoids unnecessary calculations, improving scalability for large datasets.

**Avoids Unnecessary Complexity**

- Unlike weighted sum or averaging techniques, this method provides clear, interpretable results.
- Ensures that each pg_id gets one definitive value, simplifying further analysis.

#### Limitations

**Not Suitable for Continuous or Gradual Data**

- This function only works for categorical or classification-based data.
- For continuous data (e.g., rainfall, temperature, population density), weighted averaging would be more appropriate.

**Sensitive to Small Differences in Proportional Area**

- If two values have nearly identical Proportional_area, the function will still assign only one, potentially misrepresenting edge cases.

- Possible Improvement: Introduce a minimum dominance threshold to prevent assignment when the area difference is insignificant.

**No Consideration for Alternative Metrics**

- The function only considers Proportional_area and does not factor in population influence
