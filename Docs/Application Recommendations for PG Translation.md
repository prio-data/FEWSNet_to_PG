# Application Recommendations for Data Aggregation Functions

This document outlines scenarios where each function might be most applicable.

## 1. `assign_combined_threshold`
- **Use When**:
  - You need to prioritize rows meeting both area and critical value thresholds.
  - A fallback mechanism is required for cases where no rows meet thresholds.
- **Example Application**:
  - Assigning critical infrastructure scores to priogrids based on combined thresholds.

## 2. `assign_majority_overlap`
- **Use When**:
  - You want to assign a single dominant value based on the largest proportional area.
- **Example Application**:
  - Assigning land-use classifications to priogrids based on the dominant land type.

## 3. `calculate_weighted_values`
- **Use When**:
  - You need to calculate weighted averages without additional thresholds or conditions.
- **Example Application**:
  - Aggregating economic indicators from administrative areas to priogrids.

## 4. `assign_max_above_threshold_with_fallback`
- **Use When**:
  - You want to prioritize maximum values for large areas while providing a fallback mechanism.
- **Example Application**:
  - Assigning population density to priogrids where larger areas are weighted more heavily.

## 5. `aggregate_by_greatest_population`
- **Use When**:
  - You want to prioritize rows with the greatest population proportion.
- **Example Application**:
  - Mapping humanitarian aid needs to priogrids based on population concentration.

## 6. `aggregate_with_weighted_proportions`
- **Use When**:
  - You want to balance population and area proportions with adjustable weighting.
- **Example Application**:
  - Designing hybrid indices that incorporate population and area data for development planning.
