- **admin1**: First level administrative boundaries
- **admin2**: Second level administrative boundaries
- **fsc_admin**: Food Security Classification unit of analysis based on an Administrative Unit
- **fsc_admin_lhz**: Food Security Classification unit of analysis based on the intersection of an Administrative Unit and a Livelihood Zone
- **idp_camp**: Point location for internally displaced persons
- **livelihood_zone**: Livelihood zone
- **market**: Point location for market price data

| **Attribute**    | **fsc_admin**                                         | **fsc_rm_admin**                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**         | Administrative level for food security classification | Administrative level for remote monitoring data      |
| **Purpose**       | Indicates where IPC phases are classified             | Indicates where remote monitoring data is collected  |
| **Granularity**   | Can vary from Admin0 to Admin3 or custom zones        | Typically coarser, often Admin0 or Admin1            |
| **Use Case**      | For regions with ground-level data collection         | For regions with limited access or ground data       |


Information on how `FNID` is structured:
https://help.fews.net/fde/fews-net-ids-fnids

In Afghanistan, FEWS NET maps FIC data using the intersection of Admin 2 (districts) and livelihood zones. The FNIDs for these intersect units are structured as follows:

- So where do I access livelihood zones to get spatial boundaries?
- where do I access IDP spatial boundaries (or other non admin boundaries)?
